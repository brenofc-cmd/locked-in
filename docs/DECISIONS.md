# Decisions

Only decisions that shape the project. Newest at the bottom.

# ADR-001 — Next.js App Router on Vercel

Decision: Use Next.js with the App Router, deployed on Vercel.
Reason: First-class Vercel support, Server Components by default, simple integration with Supabase via `@supabase/ssr`.
Alternatives considered: Vite SPA (no server rendering or cookie auth out of the box), Remix/React Router (fine, but less direct Vercel/Supabase path).
Status: Accepted.

# ADR-002 — Versions chosen by the `create-next-app` compatibility set

Decision: Pin the versions `create-next-app@latest` resolved on 2026-09-23 and add the rest at their latest stable:
Next 16.3.6 · React / React DOM 19.2.8 · TypeScript 5.9.3 · Tailwind CSS 4.3.3 · ESLint 9.39.5 + eslint-config-next 16.3.6 · @supabase/supabase-js 2.117.1 · @supabase/ssr 0.12.7 · Vitest 5.0.1 · Playwright 1.63.0 · Prettier 3.9.9 · Node ≥ 22 (@types/node 22).
Reason: That set is the one Next.js itself tests together. Newer majors exist (TypeScript 7.0, ESLint 10, React 19.3) but `eslint-config-next` and the Next TS plugin target TS 5 / ESLint 9, so jumping ahead would trade stability for nothing. `npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities.
Alternatives considered: TypeScript 7 / ESLint 10 now (not yet the Next.js default set); `--legacy-peer-deps` to force Vitest peers (rejected: aligned `@types/node` to the Node 22 runtime instead).
Status: Accepted. Revisit when `create-next-app` moves to the new majors.

# ADR-003 — Supabase is the only backend

Decision: Supabase Postgres + Auth + Realtime + Presence, accessed with the official SDK. No ORM, no custom server, no second database.
Reason: Two-user app; RLS gives per-row security without an API layer; Realtime/Presence cover the partner features directly.
Alternatives considered: Firebase (rejected by product brief), Prisma/Drizzle (extra layer with no gain here), custom Express/Nest API (unneeded).
Status: Accepted.

# ADR-004 — Design reference preserved read-only; v3 visual + v2 behaviour

Decision: Keep both Claude Design ZIPs byte-identical in `design-reference/original-zips/` and an unzipped copy in `design-reference/export/`. `Locked In v3.dc.html` is the primary visual reference; `Locked In v2.dc.html` is the behaviour reference because v3's logic script is an empty stub.
Reason: v3 is the latest layout and IA, but only v2 contains the working simulated logic (swipe thresholds, sizing tokens, feed rules).
Alternatives considered: Rendering the `.dc.html` runtime inside the app (rejected: prototype runtime, inline styles, not maintainable).
Status: Accepted.

# ADR-005 — Libraries added when first used

Decision: `lucide-react`, `date-fns` and `recharts` are part of the official stack but are installed in the stage that first uses them (Stage 2 / 4 / 7), not in Stage 1.
Reason: No unused dependencies; each install is then checked against the current version and the design (the design's icons are custom inline SVGs, so Lucide may only be needed for secondary icons).
Alternatives considered: Install everything up front.
Status: Accepted.

# ADR-006 — Tests: Vitest (jsdom) + Playwright on a mobile profile

Decision: Unit/component tests with Vitest + Testing Library in jsdom (`tests/unit`). E2E with Playwright against a production build (`next build && next start` on port 3100), default project = Pixel 7 emulation.
Reason: Mobile-first product; testing the production build catches build-only issues.
Status: Accepted.
